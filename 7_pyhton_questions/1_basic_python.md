# Python questions (Python Basics)

## 1. What are the characteristics of Python Programming Language?

Ans: Python is

- Easy to learn
- Powerful & interpreted programming language
- Efficient high-level data structures
- Effective approach to object-oriented programming
- Elegant syntax and dynamic typing
- Ideal for scripting and rapid application development
- Useful in various domains on most platforms

## 2. Difference between Interpreted and Compiled languages

Ans: Codes written in high-level languages are required to be translated into machine codes or binary codes with the help of interpreters or compilers.

### Compiled languages

The complete source code is compiled into binary code by a compiler. It is not completely portable and can not run on every platform. Once compiled the source code can be run again and again as required.
C, C++, Rust and Go are a few examples of compiled languages.

### Interpreted Languages

Instead of complete source code, the interpreter translates the source code instructions by instructions into binary code. Therefore when each time we run a program an interpreter runs.
Python, Ruby, PHP and JavaScript are a few examples of compiled languages.

    - Booleans are a subtype of integers
  - Float
  - Complex Numbers
- Sequence Type
  - List
  - Tuple
  - Range
