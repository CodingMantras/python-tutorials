# Pathlib module

The pathlib module is a part of the Python standard library that provides an object-oriented interface for working with file paths. It allows us to create, manipulate, and operate on file paths in a platform-agnostic way.

The pathlib module provides a set of classes that represent file paths as objects, rather than just strings. These classes provide a number of methods for working with file paths, such as `exists()`, `is_file()`, and `mkdir()`.

For example, we can use the Path class from the pathlib module to create a file path object, and then use the exists() method to check whether the file or directory specified by the path exists:

```python
from pathlib import Path

path = Path('/path/to/file')
if path.exists():
    print('The file or directory exists')
else:
    print('The file or directory does not exist')

```

You can also use the Path class to manipulate file paths, such as by changing the name or extension of a file, or by joining multiple file paths together.

Overall, the pathlib module provides a convenient and object-oriented way to work with file paths in Python. It can be particularly useful when you need to perform file system operations that involve complex file paths, or when you need to work with file paths in a platform-agnostic way.

## Difference between Pathlib and OS modules of Python

Pathlib and os are both Python modules that provide functions for working with file and directory paths. Pathlib is a more modern and object-oriented way of working with file paths, while os is a more traditional, functional way of working with file paths.

Here are some differences between the two modules:

|Pathlib|OS|
|-------------------|-------------------------|
|It provides a more intuitive and Pythonic interface for working with file paths, using classes and methods to represent and manipulate file paths. |It provides a more procedural interface, with functions that perform various operations on file paths.|
|It represents paths as objects with useful methods and attributes|It represents paths as strings.|
|pathlib is generally easier to use and more readable, especially when working with long chains of path manipulations. It also has a more consistent API and better support for Unicode paths.|os is generally more powerful and flexible, and is often used in cases where pathlib does not provide the necessary functionality. It also has a wider range of functions for working with the operating system and the filesystem.
