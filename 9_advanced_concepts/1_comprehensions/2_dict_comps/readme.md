# Dictionary comprehensions (Dict-Comps)

- Quick way to create dictionaries. (Key : Value)
- We combine the for loop and the creation of new key and value by appending each new key, value in a dictionary. (simultaneously)

## Benefits
--> more readable code
--> faster running time
--> smaller syntax
--> local scope for the variable.


## Drawbacks
- Hard to debug
- Less readable if extended more than two lines

## Examples 
1. Using multiple If-condition in a dict comprehension

2. Using Nested For-loops in a dict Comprehension
