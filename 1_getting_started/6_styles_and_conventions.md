# Styles and Conventions

Python is an easy-to-learn and interpreted programming language. It has its own set of rules and grammar, just like any other language. Let's check these rules one by one.

## 1. Comment

A single-line comment starts with `#`.

```python
# This is a comment

a = b + 5   # This is an inline comment. 
```

### Multiline comments

Wrap lines in triple quotes  `""" """` for multiline comments. In Python, we use triple quotes for documenting a Python function, class or module also.

```python
def add(a, b):
    """A function to add two variables.

    Args:
    a = int
    b = int 
    
    Return:
    Result(int) of sum of two integers.
    """

    return a + b
```

## 2. Variables naming

- Start with a letter or the underscore character
- Cannot start with a number
- Contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Case-sensitive (name, Name, NAME are different)
- [Reserved keywords](https://github.com/CodingMantras/python-tutorials/blob/master/1_getting_started/6_styles_and_conventions.md#6-reserved-keywords) should not be used as variable names.

## 3. Functions and Classes naming

Function names follow the same convention as variable names.

Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. Function names should be self-explanatory.

```python
def calculate_area(radius):
    ...
```

For naming a Python class use upper-camel-cases(Pascal case) where all words first letter is uppercase, like: Person, CalculateTax, AccountEmployee etc

```python

class Person:
    ...
```

## 4. Code continuation in next line

Use `\` to denote the code continuation to the next line.

```python
result = first_number + \
        second_number + \
        third_number

# But in case of (), and [] '\' is not required.
result = (first_number +
          second_number +
          third_number)
# or
a_long_list = ['A', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox',
               'jumps', 'over', 'a', 'lazy', 'dog']
```

## 5. Dunder methods

The name **dunder** is derived from double underscore. In Python, the Special methods are covered with double underscore. like `__str__`, `__dict__`, `__add__`, `__init__`.

Use the Python inbuilt method `dir()` to find out the list of all the double underscore methods for any python object.

```python
a_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(dir(a_list))

# Output:
['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__delitem__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__iadd__', '__imul__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__',
    '__mul__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__reversed__', '__rmul__', '__setattr__', '__setitem__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'append', 'clear', 'copy', 'count', 'extend', 'index', 'insert', 'pop', 'remove', 'reverse', 'sort']

# Upto __subclasshook__ are the double underscore methods.

# Further in tutorials we will understand how to extract the exact desired things from a list, like:
only_dunder = [item for item in dir(a_list) if item.startswith("__")]
print(only_dunder)
['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__delitem__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__iadd__', '__imul__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__reversed__', '__rmul__', '__setattr__', '__setitem__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__']
```

## 6. Reserved keywords

The following words are [reserved keywords](https://docs.python.org/3.8/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords) in Python programming language:

||||||||
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|False|await|else |import|pass|None|break|
|except|in|raise|True|class|finally|is|
|return|and|continue|for|lambda|try|as|
|def|from|nonlocal|while|assert|del|global|
|not|with|async|elif|if|or|yield|

## 7. Code blocks

Many other languages use `{}` to denote a code block. But, Python only uses `indentation` to denote a code block.

In the function below:

```python
def increment_by_5(number):
    number = number + 5
    return number

print(increment_by_5(4))
```

The second and third lines of code are indented by `4 spaces` to denote that it belongs to the function `increment_by_5`. whereas the `print` statement is not indented, which denotes it is outside of the function.

Through out the tutorial, we will have plenty of examples to get used to it.

print(increment_by_5(4))

## 8. PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code

From [Python docs](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/):
> PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals) are a design document providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes or environment. The PEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

PEP 8 gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising the standard library in the main Python distribution.

## 9. The "Zen of Python"

Originally thought as "The way of Python", "The Zen of Python" is created by Tim Peters on 19 Aug 2004. Tim Peters is one of the legendary Pythoneer often referred to as "Timbot" in the Python community. The Zen of Python is the 19 guiding principles for Python.

To check these guideline, in a python interpreter type `import this`. You will find these 19 statements as an output to this command.

```python
import this

# output:
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

## 10. Help from python docs

```python
# use help() function
print(help(any_python_object))

# Output: Detailed explanation of that python object from python docs.

# Like for list:
print(help(list))
```
