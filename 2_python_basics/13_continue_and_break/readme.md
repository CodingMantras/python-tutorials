# Break and Continue statements.

## Where to use them?
- Used in loops
- Used to alter the flow of a normal loop. 
- These statements are useful in controlling our loops.

## Break
- Used to break the flow of the loop. It helps the program to come out of the loop on meeting a specific condition.

- If used in the nested loops then break the flow of the inner loop only.

- Practical(Break statement)
    - from the texts "A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" print up to 's'.
    - from a list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] print every number up to '5'.

## Continue
- Continues the loop without iterating over the remaining statements inside the loop.

- It means, when the python interpreter sees the continue statement it gets back to the first line of the loop, so the rest of the code doesn't run in that iteration.

- Practical(Continue statement)
    - from the texts "A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" print everything except the letter 's'.
    - from a list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] print every number except 5.
