# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3]

# Unpack the elements of the list and assign them to separate variables
a, b, c = numbers
print(a, b, c)

# Output:

# Define a list of strings
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

# Unpack the elements of the list and assign them to separate variables
fruit1, fruit2, fruit3 = fruits
print(fruit1, fruit2, fruit3)
# Output:

# Define a list of tuples
data = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]

# Unpack the elements of the list and assign the values in each tuple to separate variables
a, b = data

# The variables a and b now have the values (1, 2) and (3, 4), respectively
