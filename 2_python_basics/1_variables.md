# Python variables

In any programming language variables are one of the most important basic-concept. Variables are used to hold/reference the data. In few languages variables can be considered as the box containing a value or data. But in Python the variable does not hold the value itself, but they hold the reference to that value.

## Variables in Python don't hold the data, they reference to the location of the data.

```python
developer_name = "Rahul"            # string
age = 30                            # int
experience_in_years = 5.8           # float
programming_language = "Python"     # string
is_on_leave = False                 # boolean
```
Here, ðŸ‘† `developer_name`, `age`, `experience_in_years`, `programming_language` and `is_on_leave` are a few examples of variables in Python

Check the ids of the variables above
```python
developer_name = "Rahul"
print(id(developer_name))       # 140549527402160

age = 100
print(id(age))                  # 9804416

experience_in_years = 150.25
print(id(experience_in_years))  # 140118263398640

is_on_leave = False
print(id(is_on_leave))          # 9486304

# But in case of list.

b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(id(b))                    # 140118263437440

# if we append the list the id remains same and the list get appended to the same memory location
b.append(6)
print(id(b))                    # 140118263437440
```

## Dynamic typing nature of Python

Python is called dynamically typed language which means variables are created without type hinting the variable name. Which means variable can reference to any type of object. Therefore, if we do the following, Python does not complain:
```python
a = 'Python'             # referencing string
a = 100                 # referencing int
a = 150.25              # referencing float
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]     # referencing list
```
Python creates the variable whenever we assign any type of object to it. We read it as the variable 'a' is assigned to the object 'Rahul', as an object is created first and then it is available to be assigned to any variable.

## Id, Type and Values
In Python everything is an object and every object have identity, value and a type.

**ID**: An id is the object's address in the memory and it never changes once it is created. Use in-built function `id()` to check the identity of any object. It returns an integer.

```python
language = "Python"
print(id(language))     # 140549527402160
``` 

**Type**: The operations that an object supports are determine by an objectâ€™s type. The type also defines the possible values for that object. Use in-built function `type()` to check an objectâ€™s type. 

```python
a = 'Python'
print(type(a))          # <class 'str'>

a = 100
print(type(a))          # <class 'int'>

a = 150.25
print(type(a))          # <class 'float'>

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(type(a))          # <class 'list'>
```

Even the `type` function is an object of some type. Let's check this:
```python
print(type(type))       # <class 'type'>
```

**Like an object's identity, the type is also unchangeable.** 

**Value**: The value of some objects is changed. The objects whose values can be changed are called **mutable**, and the objects whose values can not be changed are called **immutable**. There is a separate tutorial for immutable and mutable data types.

## Single line assignment
```python
a, b, c = 4, 5, 6
```
## Constants
While declaring a variable value as constant, python convention is to use variable names in capital.
```python
PI = 3.14
INCREMENT = 7
```

## Protected and Private variables
```python
# Protected variable: starting with single underscore('_')
_student_name = 'John'

# Protected variable: starting with double underscore('__')
_company_name = 'XYZ Company'
```
